Spam Mail Prediction Using Logistic Regression

This project, completed during my internship with Oasis, focuses on predicting spam emails using a Logistic Regression model. The dataset contains two columns:

1.Category: Labels as spam or ham.

2.Message: The email content.

Key Highlights:

Preprocessed data for text-to-numeric conversion.

Implemented and trained the Logistic Regression model for binary classification.

Achieved high accuracy in identifying spam messages.
